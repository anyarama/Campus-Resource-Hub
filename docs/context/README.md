# Context Pack
## Campus Resource Hub - AI-First Development Context

This directory contains planning artifacts that provide context for AI-assisted development. These materials help AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Cline) understand the project's business goals, user needs, and process requirements.

## Folder Structure

### `/APA` - Agility, Processes & Automation
Artifacts from the Agility & Process Automation module including:
- Process models (BPMN, future-state workflows)
- Acceptance test scenarios
- Backlog items and sprint planning
- Automation requirements

### `/DT` - Design Thinking
User-centered design artifacts including:
- User personas
- Journey maps
- Empathy maps
- Usability findings
- Interview insights

### `/PM` - Product Management
Strategic product artifacts including:
- Product strategy briefs
- OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)

### `/shared` - Shared Resources
Common materials referenced across modules:
- Glossary of terms
- Consolidated personas

## Purpose

These artifacts serve three key functions:

1. **AI Context Grounding**: Help AI tools generate relevant, context-aware code
2. **Documentation**: Preserve design decisions and requirements
3. **Alignment**: Ensure consistent understanding across development phases

## Usage

When prompting AI tools, reference these materials:
```
"Based on the student persona in /docs/context/DT/personas.md, 
generate the booking flow that addresses their pain points..."
```

## Maintenance

Update these artifacts as:
- User research reveals new insights
- Business requirements evolve
- Process improvements are identified
- Strategic priorities shift
